# vim

In order to get these plugins to work, you're going to need to install [#Vundle.](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim). So click that and do what it says.

Now you're going to have to clone this repo and replace your .vimrc with mine. In your shell, type the following:

    $ git clone http://github.com/agcollins/vim_agc ~/ && cp ~/vim_agc/.vimrc ~/ 

Now, just as in the #Vundle installation README, you're going to open vim and do :PluginInstall (if you have previously installed plugins with vundle, run a :PluginClean before you install).

In order to get the Solarized colorscheme working, you're going to have to ensure you're using a 256 color terminal (or gvim).

The .vimrc file should have enough comments to be able to understand what's going on and what each line does.


Now enjoy my .vimrc!
